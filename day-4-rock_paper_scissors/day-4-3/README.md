## Treasure Map

# Instructions

You are going to write a program which will mark a spot with an X.

The map is made of 3 rows of blank squares.

      1      2      3

1 ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
2 ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
3 ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

Your program should allow you to enter the position of the treasure using a two-digit system. The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number. e.g.:

# Example Input 1

column 2, row 3 would be entered as:

```
23
```

# Example Output 1

```
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
```

```
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
```

```
['⬜️', 'X', '⬜️']
```

# Example Input 2

column 3, row 1 would be entered as:

```
31
```

# Example Output 2

```
['⬜️', '⬜️', 'X']
```

```
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
```

```
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:
