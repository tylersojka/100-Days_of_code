## Heads or Tails

# Instructions

You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails". 

**Important**, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

Don't worry about the lines 3-4, it's there to allow us to test your code.

You need to generate a random number, either 0 or 1.

```
1 means Heads
```

```
0 means Tails 
```

# Example Output

```
Heads
```

or

```
Tails
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:
